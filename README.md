# Caesar Cipher Brute Force Application
The Caesar Cipher Brute Force application is designed to help users decrypt a ciphertext that has been encrypted using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number, and this application attempts all possible shifts (from 0 to 25) to find the correct decryption.

# Key Features:
 Brute Force Decryption: The application performs a brute force attack on the Caesar cipher by trying all possible shifts, displaying the results for each shift.

 Multiple Alphabet Support: Users can choose between English and Turkish alphabets. The application will adapt the shift logic based on the selected alphabet (e.g., Turkish includes additional characters like 'ç', 'ğ', and 'ı').

 Interactive User Interface: The user-friendly interface allows users to input their ciphertext, choose the alphabet, and view the decrypted results instantly. The results are displayed in a scrollable text area, which makes it easy to examine all possible decrypted texts.

 Modern and Clean Design: The application features a modern and visually appealing design using a blue color theme. It is clean, simple, and easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless user experience.

#Decryption Process: The decryption process is initiated when the user clicks the "Decrypt" button. While the process is running, input fields are temporarily disabled to avoid interruption.

# How It Works:
 Enter Ciphertext: Users input the encrypted text they wish to decrypt into the provided text field.

 Choose Alphabet: The user selects the appropriate alphabet (English or Turkish) to ensure the correct decryption based on language-specific characters.

 Decrypt: Upon clicking the "Decrypt" button, the application will attempt all 26 possible shifts of the Caesar cipher and display the results in a scrolling text box. This allows the user to review all potential decryptions.

 View Results: The decrypted texts for each shift are shown, and the user can easily compare them to identify the correct one.

# Why Use This Application?
 Brute Force Method: By trying every possible shift, it guarantees finding the correct decryption, even if the shift number is unknown.
 Support for Multiple Alphabets: The application supports different alphabets, which is useful for languages with special characters.
 Easy to Use: The interface is simple and easy to understand, making it accessible even for users with minimal experience in cryptography.
